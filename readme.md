<h1>Dog Party</h1>

<p>In this project, we were given two comprehensive layouts of a webpage styled in two different ways. We were asked to re-create the comps by writing one HTML document and two CSS documents. We were then asked to give the site some minor functionality using JavaScript. 

Here you will find the initial image for Comp 1, as well as my re-creation of it:</p>
